Welcome to **Create: Post Production**! Create: Post Production is a modpack aimed at pushing Create to its absolute limits. The bulk of the pack's content is centered around the Create mod and its many addons. We have hand-picked and hand-tested every Create addon in this pack, ensuring it fits within the theme of complete automation and industrialization. While centered around the Create mod and its addons, **this pack contains over 300 mods, while still keeping that Vanilla+ Create feel**. The full list of mods can be found below. As mods update, barring any conflicts or incompatibilities, they will also be updated in the pack.

**Q. Can you add x mod?**

**A.** Check the [master list](https://github.com/Packagers-of-Create/Create-Post-Production/issues/1) and ensure the mod isn't listed. If it isn't, you can submit a [feature request](https://github.com/Packagers-of-Create/Create-Post-Production/issues/new?template=mod-request.md) and it will be looked into.

**Q. My game is crashing/I am getting x error.**

**A.** You can open an [issue](https://github.com/Packagers-of-Create/Create-Post-Production/issues/new?template=bug-report.md). Make sure to provide steps to be able to recreate the error/crash and we will review it as soon as possible.

**Q. How can I support the project?**

**A.** You can support the Create mod [here](https://github.com/Creators-of-Create/Create/wiki/Supporting-the-Project). Any support or donations should go to them, as they are the ones that make this all possible.

**Q. When will you update to 1.21.1/upgrade or downgrade to x version?**

**A.** Since Create for 1.21.1 released recently, the majority of it's addons are still on 1.20.1. Since they are the core of this modpack, the modpack cannot yet update to 1.21.1. When the majority of its addons are updated the pack will update. Keep in mind this transfer from 1.20.1 to 1.21.1 will not be perfect, and some mods will not transfer over, so **worlds on 1.20.1 most likely will not be comaptible with 1.21.1**. **This modpack will never be backported**, because it is based on Create 6, which is exclusive to 1.20.1 and 1.21.1. As Create updates to newer versions, so will its addons and so will this pack.

**Q. Will there be a Fabric Pack?**

**A:** Short answer: No. Since this modpack uses mods from both Forge and Fabric (via Sinytra Connector), it must be built on Forge, since there is currently no way to load Forge mods on the Fabric loader (Yes, I am aware that [Kilt](https://github.com/KiltMC) exists, but it is currently not yet in a state where it is playable.) Once Create 6 releases for Fabric **AND** Kilt or an alternative is in a relatively stable state, I will consider making a pack for Fabric

Big thanks to the following for allowing the use of their CurseForge project in the modpack:
 - **Vi_Tul:** [Recolorful Containers (Dark)](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/recolourful-containers-gui-hud-dark)

Again, none of this would be possible without the [Create](https://modrinth.com/mod/create) mod, and the efforts of their team and the teams of all of the other mods in this pack. If you enjoy the Create mod and want to support, consider [donating](https://github.com/Creators-of-Create/Create/wiki/Supporting-the-Project) to them, as it helps out a ton. **All donation links are to the official Create ones.**
